What epsilon u want,choose any number between 0 to 1 : 
But for better training prefer lesser value of epsilon
What alpha u want,choose any number between 0 to 1
choose gridsize of tic-tac-toe
How many times do you want to train the Agent
For how many games u want to calculate probablity after each Training i.e checkCount :
If u thoose both no of trains and checkCount a high no,it may take a lot of time to calculate 
Please enter the data again that u entered now !
cc is : 10
What was the epsilon ?
Enter the Alpha again :-)
What was the size of tic-tac-toe?

Enter value of checkCount again :-)
